              Welcome to the Seeder main page. The best place to find information
              about seeder is at its source homepage which can be found
              <a href="http://github.com/openecho/Seeder">here</a> on
              <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>.

              Seeder is a few things, most of which are not serious right now;
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>A place for me to record and transparently track content for my research at <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/">The University of Newcastle</a>.</li>
              <li>A task that produces something useful while allowing me to learn new technologies (Grails, Groovy, Open Containers) and leverage my existing skills (Java).</li>
              <li>A tool that I am in control of that I can apply the methods that are artifacts of my research.</li>
              <li>An interesting idea that others may find useful.</li>
              <li>All of the concepts I am required to implement for this application are required in other more important ideas I have.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              I am not trying to re-invent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a> and if you have any idea about
              the restrictions in regards to content on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a> then you would agree.
              Why did I not just use <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">mediawiki</a>? See points 02, 03 and 05.
